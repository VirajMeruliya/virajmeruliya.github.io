      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a theoretical physicist who recently obtained his Ph.D. from the Department of Physics, McGill University. In addition to my academic work, I have cultivated skills in data science and machine learning, applying techniques such as neural networks and statistical modeling to solve real-world problems. I will be joining the Risk Management team at RBC from June 2025.</p>
